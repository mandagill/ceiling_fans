### Fan code generator

This is a program to generate a list of codes for the Aerotron line of ceiling fans so that no remotes are accidentally paired with the wrong fan that happens to be within 7 meters (approximately 20 feet). Documentation for the fan is here, details on pairing remote controls are here on page 9: http://aeratronaustralia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/UM_02_2013-v-13.pdf

## Context

My apartment building uses these fans, and they are nice. But unfortunately, my neighbors' remote controls will occasionally use the same code that my fans are programmed to use. This means that they control my ceiling fans when they adjust their own fan speed, direction, et cetera. So to prevent the nice maintenance person from having to respond to various help tickets from my neighbors, I'm creating a list of codes so that he can reprogram all of the remotes and not have to worry about the issue any more.
